CHANPTER 1

Section 1:	PHONEMIC INVENTORY of VULCAN


Premiminary remark: 1) This phonemic inventory represents modern Vulcan.
	 	    2) The English equivalents of the pronunciation of
		       the phonemes are only very approximative.


VOWELS:    i          u          i:          u:
             e      o               e:     o:
short            ^                      ^:           long
                 a                      a: 

There are many vowel sequences which may be described as 'diphtongs';
ai (transcribed in broad Eng. transcription usually by -y- as in the
    Vulcan word "t'hyla" [t'haila]. (p.s. there shloud be accents on the
    ai - can't do that on this computer. Will have to send the post
    August version via snail on PC disks).
ei, oi, au,eu,ou, etc.

Nasalized vowels: e~, o~, a~

i - as in Eng. pit
u - as in Eng. put
e -    "       set
o -    "       not
^ -    "       but in fast speech; almost as final vowel in "teacher".
a - as in French patte
i: - as in Eng. mean
u: - as in Eng. prune
e: - as in French prenez (emphatic)
o: - as in Eng. fault
^: -     "      sir ; lengthened pronunciation.


CONSONANTS:

	p b f v w~ w m
        t d th dh    n
	c z sh zh
	k g x h      ng
	ks q
	j r l w~l rh

p - as in Eng. put
b -     "      but
f -     "      folk
v -     "      veal
w~-     "      no Eng. equivalent; voicless w (voiceless bilabial fricative)
w -     "      white
m -     "      man
t -     "      top
d -     "      door
th -    "      t with aspiration (i.e. t with h-release; not like Eng. the)
dh -    "      d  "     "            " d   "   "         "    "    "   
n -     "      not
c -     "     [ts] as in tse-tse fly
z -     "      zero
sh -    "      shoot
zh -    "      measure, but even more strongly voiced and with slight h-release
ch -    "      church
dzh -         [d]+[zh] pronounced as one voiced sound.
k - as in Eng. clock
g -    "       go
x - as in Scot. loch, ach; or German Bach (J.S.Bach)
h - as in Eng. hut
ng -     "     hung
ks -     "     lax
q  -     "     quote, but still more "velar" and emphatic.
j -      "     yolk, yes.
r - as in Italien bravo, or rather in Spanish Carrera, very strongly 
	        articulated (voiced vbrant).
l - as in Eng. logic ( that famous word again)
w~l -           voicless bilabial fricative + lateral as one sound
rh -            voiced retroflex vibrant, somewhat like American or
		Irish 'r'.
n~ - as in Span. man~ana, Fr. mignon
' -             glottal catch; this serves also as syllable-boundary. Thus
		e.g. the word t'hyla "friend etc" is pronounced so that
		there is a strong onset [t] followed by offset overshort
		pause with glottal catch ['], with main dynamic accent
		on the first vowel of the diphthong, hence [t+'haila]/


Consonent clusters are not avoided; on the contrary, clusters of two
consonants are frequent kroy (stop), Katra, plak (blood), t'kahr (teacher),
T'Pring, etc.
Attention should be paid to the fact that consonant ( and vowel) sequences
with ' are NOT to be intepreted as consonant clusters (vowel diphthongs):
t'hyla, t'kahr, Kahs'wan, ka'athyra. (Pronounced [Kat' athaira] with very
brief pause between the two vowels a, and  with stresses distributed like `'
i.e. secondary stress on [Ka] and primary stress on [tha].

	   a later date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

CHAPTER 2 	WORD-CLASSES (Part of speech system)

There are in Vulcan (V.) isolatable units which can be classified as
either free forms or bound forms. We can distinguish among six word-classes.

1a:	Action-words, e.g. Kroy (stop), Imroy (walk), Ran (kill), 
	Spara (eat), Tichoy (live), Matoy (die).

1b:	State-words, e.g. Kya [kaia] (exist), Kyani (non-exist); e.g. with
	interrog. particle - Qa kya qa kyani - (interrog. exist, interrog.
	non-exist) or loosely translated "To be or not to be".
	others: Mata (be dead), Tich (be alive) etc.

2a:	Sentient-entity words, e.g. t'hyla (Friend/lover etc), Sehlat (
	Vulcan "teddy-bear"), Le'matya (Omnivorous Vulcan predator), Horta
	( sentient silicon-based living thing).

2b: 	Non-Sentient-entity words, e.g. Kreyla (Vulcan biscuits), Ka'athyra
	(Stringed musical instrument) etc.

This division does not correspond to carbon- vs. non-carbon based dichotomy.
 
3:	Deictic words; there are five degrees of deixis:
	1. this here (visible), e.g. 	 i-plak (this blood)
	2. this near (not visible) e.g.	 e-plak (this blood)
	3. that these (visible) e.g. 	 a-plak (that blood)
	4. that these (not visible) e.g. u-plak (that blood)
	5. that (distantial) e.g. 	 o-plak (that blood)

Under Deictic words, we include in this description what is generally
described as the system of personal pronouns. This system distinguishes
between the categories of inclusive (we-speakers + you-listeners) and
exclusive (we-speakers - you-listeners) in 1st person plural. It also
distinguishes between five degrees of Deixis in the 3rd person. And it
also has a special paradigm for honorific ( suffix -kan (elder/more honorific)
and -kam (to younger (affectionate) honorific. e.g. when Spock speaks with
Savik he addresses her as Savikam). 

SINGULAR:

1. 	th' I				th'kan(m) I-hon.	
2. 	s'  you				s'kan(m)  you-hon.
3.1.	iw' he (visible)		iw'kan(m) he-hon.
3.2.	ew' he (not visible)		ew'kan(m) 
3.3.	aw' he (visible: see above)	aw'kan(m)
3.4.	uw' he (not visib. see above)	uw'kan(m)
3.5. 	ow' he (distantial)		ow'kan(m)
3.2.1	iwl' she (visible)		iwl'kan(m)
	.
	.
	.
3.2.5  owl' she (distantial)		owl'kan(m)
3.3.1  in'  it (visible)
3.3.2  en'  it (not visib. see above)   "it" can have honorific
       .				 form when applied to 'sexless'
       .				 sentient phenomena
3.3.5  on'

PLURAL

1. the's' we (inclusive)		the's'kan(m) we hon.
   the'   we (exclusive)		the'kan(m)
2. se'    you				se'kan(m)
3.1  iwe' they (m.vis.)			iwe'kan(m)
     .
     .
	
3.2. iwle' they(f.vis.)			iwle'kan(m)
       ,
       .
3.3. ine'  they (n.vis.)		ine'kan(m)
      .
     etc

e.g. plaks'ran (leukocupricytosis) lit.  "blood you kill"


4: QUALIFIERS

4.a. Qualifiers of entity-words, e.g. Krup (blue), Sbah (red),
     e.g. "Spock'at krupat'oram u-plak" (Spock{gen. poss} green that-invisible
     -blood), or (That green blood of Mr. Spock) and "Kirk'at sbah i-plaplak"
     (This red [precious] blood of Kirk)*. Other qualifiers are e.g. near
     ditant, large, small etc.

4.b. Qualifiers of action/state words. e.g. Brax (fast) as in e.g.
     " Brax imroy" (walk fast), or, "Brax imimroykah" (walk very fast!!)**.

* cf. explication of colours: Literally; Krupat'oram< (blue)+at'or (0.7+0.3)
      + ram (Yellow)=blueish green (Colours will be dealt with later, numbers
      too).

** See below for intensive reduplication.

5: NUMBER WORDS.

Vulcan has pentagonal system. Also there are many words expressions dealing
with calculative vocabulary of the Vulcans and only the most basic is
given below.

1=ri'		6=ti'
2=ra'		7=ta'
3=ro'		8=to'
4=re'		9=te'
5=ru'	       10=tu'

0=i'

Vulcan has also specific words for fractions from 0.1 to 0.9 ;

0.1 = ir, 0.2 = ar, 0.3 = or, 0.4 = er, 0.5 = ur, 
0.6 = it, 0.7 = at, 0.8 = ot, 0.9 = et.

e.g. 2.156 = ra'irurit
    10.461 = tu'eritir (said at great speed).

On the pentagonal system is based the system applying to entity-words
expressive specially of quantities from 1 to 5; thus we have singular,
dual, trial, quatral and quintal. In Archaic Vulcan there are traces
of these systems in the verb, expressed by incorporation of numeral
forms. e.g. (you-2 stop-emphesis-command): in modern Vulcan;
"s'ra' krokroykah"  
in ancient Vulcan; " s'ra' krokroyRAkah"  or e.g. (you-3-humans walk-fast)
in mod. Vulcan; "s'ro' qomiro' brax imroykah" {ancient; imroyRAkah).
"qomiru" = five humans, BUT ti'qomie = six humans.


6: PARTICLES.

Particles are free (emphasis, interrogation-words etc) or bound forms used
prefixed, infixed or suffixed with free forms as auxiliaries: "qa" interog.
prefix e.g. "qaram" = interrog + kill;  "nirsh" =no, not, "a:" =yes.

7: CONJUNCTIONS ETC.

ong = and e.g. Spockong Kirkong (Spock and Kirk)
azh = or  e.g. "Spockazh Kirkazh" (Spock or Kirk)
niazh = neg. or e.g. " Spockniazh Kirkniazh" (neither Spock nor Kirk)
ni-+-a not A but B e.g. niSpock Kirka (not Spock but Kirk)
uks = but 
etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 3 	INTENSIVE REDUPLICATION

A characteristic feature of Vulcan language is intensive reduplication 
which is employed with action words, entity-words as well as qualifiers:

3.1. With action/state words, e.g. "Krokroykah" (Stop definitely at once!)

3.2 With entity words e.g. "th'at t'hyleat i-plaplak" (This {precious} 
    blood of my friends)
    "the'at t'hyleat a-plakhi krokroykah" (Stop {intensive} that {visible}
     blood of our {exclusive} friends!).

3.3 With qualifiers, e.g. "Kirk'at sb'sbah plakhi kroykah" (Stop the {very}
    red blood of Kirk!).

3.4. Grades of qualifiers:
	Grade 2: infixation of repeated stem-vowel,
	Grade 3: further reduplication of final syllable.

Examples:  "atsk" (big) > "atsak" (very big) > "atsakak" (immensely big)
           "itsk" (small) > "itsik" (very small) > "itsikik" (infinitely small)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 4:  POSSESSIVITY

Expressed by possessive suffix "'at" with entity-words and deictic words;
e.g. "qomia'at" (of humans) "Spock'at (Spock's)

th'at - my (mine)
s'at - yours
iw'at - his (male, visible, prox.)
iwl'at - hers (female, visible prox)
the's'at - our (inclusive)
the'at - our (exclusive)  e.g. "the;at katra" - our katra (spoken by a 
			  Vulcan towards non-Vulcan) versus "the'a'at
			  Enterprise" - our Enterprise (Spoken by Kirk to
			  Spock aboard the ship). cf. also "the'at orkike"
			  - our ancestors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 5: SYNTACTIC RELATIONSHIPS OF ENTITY-WORDS.

These are expressed by suffixation like in agglutinative languages.

			Paradigm

Singular		  Dual			Plural
t'hyla - friends	  t'hylara - 2 friends 	t'hyle ( more than 5 friends)
			  (analogicaly trial, 
			  quatral, quintal)
t'hyla'at "of the friend"  t'hylara'at		t'hyle'at
t'hyla'ha "to the friend"  t'hylara'ha		t'hyle'ha
t'hyla'hi [direct object]  t'hylara'hi		t'hyle'hi
t'hyla'he "in the friend"  t'hylara'he		t'hyle'he
	   (location)
t'hyla'ti "with friend"    t'hylara'ti		t'hyle'ti
          (instrument, association, etc.)
t'hyla'a: [allocative]     t'hylara'a:		thyle'e:

To this paradigm there are no formal exceptions.

Examples: t'hyla'at sharien - 'sword of the friends'
          t'hyla'ha shroyat'ha - ' in order to listen (i.e. verbal noun + ha)
                                   to the friend'
	  i-qomi'hi rankah - 'Kill this human!' (not often used by a Vulcan)
	  qomi'he sbah plak - ' red blood in the human'
	  Sharien'ti rankah - ' kill with the sword'
	  S'ti ht'laktra    - 'I grieve with you (you with I grieve)

Further syntatic relationships (such as 'inside in', 'ouside of', 'from'
'by', 'for the sake of' etc) are expressed with further infixation or
suffixation of certain particles and form of action-words.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 6: ACTION-STATE WORDS.

6.1. There is no abstract "verb" (state-word) 'to be'. "Being" always
     refers to a concrete state/situation/quality/quantity, i.e. '
     being so-and-so' e.g. 'to be alone', 'to be sick', to be red',
     'to be tall', to be alive', to be dead' etc.

    There is no copula "is" either. Equotional sentences are expressed by 
    simple juxtaposition in a certain syntactic order: X Y , where X=
    old information, Y = new information.

    Thus 'Spock is tall' is literally 'Spock tall' and 'Spock is commander'
    is 'Spock (X) - commander (Y).

6.2 In contrast, there is a state-word 'to exist' in opposition to 
    'to non-exist'.
     Hence, 'Spock was sick' > 'Spock sicked + ended being sick'
            'Spock was commander' > 'Spock-commander + precise temporal'

6.3. In addition, Vulcan has a state-word which cannot be translated
     only interpreted as meaning, approx., "neither exist, nor non-exist"
     or, in certain situational context, "being beyond" i.e. being beyond
     categories of time-space, beyond space-time continuum. This refers to
     "regions" whether actual or mental (e.g. in meditation) which are 
     beyond 'our' space-time coordinates.

6.4  Action/State words do have a category which can roughly be designated
     as aspectral or "Aktionsart".

     1. Timeless action/state (still being in the state of preliminary
  	discussions). Probably an action/state which has neither beginning
	nor end, and still is. e.g. th'kroy - I stop [?]

     2. Continuous present; Action/state which exists at the present time
	without determination of its begining or end. 
	Morpheme - infix MU.
	e.g. tixoy (live); in Cont. Pres. tiMUxoy, e.g. s'tiMUxoy - 'you 
	are living'

     3. Action/State to be contintued; e.g. 'I am eating ( and have not 
	finished eating but once shall finish eating).' 
	Morpheme - infix CU [tsu]
	e.g. spara (eat); th'spaCUra - 'I am eating' 

     4. Action/State to be terminated; e.g. ' I (finish) eating fast'
	Morpheme -infix KSE
	e.g. th'spaKSEra - 'I (finish) eating',
	     brax th'spaKSEra - 'I'll be finished eating fast/soon'

    5.  Action in past still going on; e.g. ' I stopped to talk to my friend'
	i.e. 'I stopped {and am still standing and talkinf}'
	Morpheme -infix ZO:
	e.g. Kroy (stop); kroyZO: - 'to have stopped (and still not moving)
	cf. th'at t'hylaha prala'at'ha th'kroyZO: - literally 'my friend [
	dative] speaking [dative] I stopped'*

* Dative of verb-noun = "in order to" i.e. I stopped in order to talk to my
  friend.

    6.	Action in past finished (terminated);
	Morpheme -infix PE 
	e.g. th'spaPEra - ' I have eaten'

    7.	Intentional Future;, 
	Morpheme -infix DZHA
	e.g. th'kroyDZHA - 'I will stop'

    8.	Non-intentional Future;
	Morphene -infix DZHU
	e.g. th'ranDZHU - 'I might kill' (I may have to kill in the future).

    9.	Negative verb
	Morpheme -infix I
	e.g. th'rIan - 'I don't kill'
	     rIankah - 'Do not Kill!'

6.5 Action/State words have the following basic forms.
    1.	STEM; e.g. Kroy (stop) Ran (kill), Kapra (calculate)
    2.	IMPERARIVE; .e.g. rankah (ran-kah) 'Kill!'
	PROHIBITIVE e.g. rIankah (see above)
    3.  PERMISIVE;  e.g. Kroma (Kroy-ma) 'may stop'
    4.	VERB-NOUN; e.g. ranat (Ran-at) ' killing'


7.0 Odds and ends (at the momment)

hr'(noun)'te relates to a group of people (Vulcans ot others) e.g.
mnah (proposal)	= hr'Mnah'te (proposal group) or kash (expunge) =
hr'Kash'te (expunging group).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES of utterances:

1. Kirkhi rankah - 'Kill Kirk!' Not to be confused with:
   Kirka: rankah - 'Kirk, Kill!'

2. Spockhi smoniyatha th'kroyDZHA - 'I will stop in order to wait for Spock'
   (Lit. Spock[object case] wait[verb-noun dative] I stop[intentional future])

3. Spock kreylaong plomikon spaCUra - 'Spock eats Vulcan biscuits and 
   Plomik-soup.

To conclude this section consisting of 6 Chapters our Vulcan advisor
(name and address has to be witheld for privacy reasons) has given us a
Vulcan poem that MAY have been composed by Surak. Loosely translated
it goes thus: (It has to do with Life and Death)

" Suddenly light
  Suddenly dark - 
  I am a shooting star too."


in Vulcan:

" Kh'liorah brax		(light fast/suddenly)
  Niorah brax - 		(dark fast/suddenly)
  kahs'khiori th'thya."		(shooting star self)


Observe the initial "rhyme" of the syllables -io- which carry the main
stress, as well as the sequence -io- in the 3rd verse.
